Interviewer : Juan (J)
Interviewee : Luís (L)
J: Hi, my name is Juan Ramírez. For my mobile app development course, we are evaluating a very important issue in Bogotá, which is pollution caused by textiles and clothing. In our proposal, we want to create an app that connects users who have clothes they want to donate with charitable organizations that need them. So first, I would like to ask if you give permission to record this interview.
L: Yes, no problem.
J: So, to start, could you tell me a little about yourself?
L: My name is Luis Ángel and I work full-time. I dedicate myself to work.
J: How often do you buy new clothes or accessories?
L: Every 4, 5, or 6 months approximately. I usually buy when there are sales or if I need something specific.
J: OK. And what usually happens with the clothes you no longer wear?
L: The clothes I don’t wear are generally stored. They end up being given to family members. Usually, my mom does it. She gives them to nephews who need them. Others, if they get damaged, are eventually thrown away.
J: So, just to confirm, you personally have never donated clothes.
L: Yes, I haven’t donated any clothes. As I said, usually my mom does it and gives them to her relatives.
J: OK. And do you know where such donations can be made?
L: No, I have no knowledge of where or how I could donate.
J: You mentioned that part of the clothes you don’t wear are given away by your family. But have you ever had clothes in good condition that ended up being thrown away even though they were still usable?
L: Yes. Yes, several times.
J: If you want to donate clothes, what difficulties or obstacles do you think you might encounter?
L: Mainly, for me, the lack of information, because I don’t know of a place or point where I could do it, or what the process is.
J: OK. If there were a tool to help you donate clothes, what information would you like it to include?
L: I would like to know, have information about the person or organization receiving the donation. I would like to know that. Also, information about the process, so that it is clear and simple.
J: And if you used the app, what would motivate you to donate clothes more often?
L: I think, as I said, that the process is very convenient and easy for me. Also, that I have the information and certainty that the donation is reaching someone who needs it.
J: If the app offered any incentives for donations or social recognition, would you use it?
L: Yes, yes. I think that would be great.
J: Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experience with disposing of, donating, or giving away clothes?
L: Well, personally, I haven’t donated clothes. As I said, they’ve been given to family members, but not to any organization or anything like that. But I do think it would be a very good option, and it’s something I would do because textile pollution from clothing seriously affects the environment. So yes, I would be very interested in being able to do it.
J: OK. Thank you very much for your cooperation.
L: Well, thank you.
